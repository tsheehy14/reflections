What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I run git status I get 'No commits yet' but when I run git commit -m 'First commit'
I get Initial commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value
do you think it offers?
It acts almost as an in between, working to ensure you don't commit everything at once.
