When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Working in a group

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you have full control over the files that you are using/so others can work on certain parts

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks involve taking from other repositories on github. Clones involve copying repositories from github to local, branch involves splitting into multiple parts

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This way you have the most up to date working on your local.
