Reflection for assignment 1:

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Was review

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Obviously it gives better context

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Con: You have to be on top of when you commit, forgetting could be very bad
Pro: Commit occur at useful moments

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
They serve different purposes. Google Docs is mainly for typing reports/essay, Git isn't.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
By simply using them... duh

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because you can always just revert it if need be

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Still working on getting that setup right...
